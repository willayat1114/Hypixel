My network provider did not allow me to connect to your server, but my parents network provider did. I tried looking up alternatives, and saw on the hypixel fourm that i could use a VPN, so i used Proton VPN and i got banned.
I Tried to get an appeal when i got banned about a year ago but couldn't.
I got interested un Minecraft again and want to play hypixel
